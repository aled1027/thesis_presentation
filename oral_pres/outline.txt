# Orals TODO
- figure out if we used FleXOR
- 2pc security definition
    - why are (S_1) and S_2 surrounded by parentheses?
    - they are not a tuple
    - \{(S_1(x, f_1(x,y), f(x,y)))\}_{x,y} \compindist \{(\viewrv^{\Pi}_1(x,y), \outputrv^{\Pi}(x,y)) \}_{x,y} \\
- 2pc security definition
    - check goldreich definition
    - are f_1 and f supposed to be inputs to simulators???
    - I say that they only take two inputs before
    - I think they are supposed to be there, but the parentheses are off
- Poker example
- Check CompGC paper on meaning of i in SCMC

    - definition
    - Yao's Garbled Circuit
        - Steps
            - Garble
                - Assign wire labels
                - Make garbled tables
            - Communicate
                - Send garbled tables
                - Send input wire labels
            - Evaluate
                - trial decrypt
                - acquire output wire label
                - Uses output wire label
        - Security
        - Complexity
- Improvements to Garbled Circuits
    - Point and Permute
    - GRR3
    - Free XOR
    - GRR2
        - skip
    - FleXOR
        - board-work if necessary
    - Half gates
        - board-work -- walk through paper
    - Improving OT
- Component-Based Garbled Circuits + SCMC
     - Naive
     - Security (hybrid proof)
     - SCMC
- Implementation and Results
    - CompGC
    - Experiments
        - mention why we chose these
        - aes 
            - commonly measured
            - might encrypt output of a function
        - cbc
            - had aes working, so not too hard to do
            - arbitrary size
        - levenshtein
            - genomic analysis
            - dynamic algo so single component
    - Results
        - table with load
        - table no load
        - naive verse scmc

# Writing TODO
- there exist(s) in encryption security definition
- type top page 22:
    - {view A (x, y)} x,y∈{0,1} ∗ }
    - extra }
- 2pc security definition
    - why are (S_1) and S_2 surrounded by parentheses?
    - they are not a tuple
    - \{(S_1(x, f_1(x,y), f(x,y)))\}_{x,y} \compindist \{(\viewrv^{\Pi}_1(x,y), \outputrv^{\Pi}(x,y)) \}_{x,y} \\
- 2pc security definition
    - check goldreich definition
    - are f_1 and f supposed to be inputs to simulators???
    - I say that they only take two inputs before
    - I think they are supposed to be there, but the parentheses are off
- GRR3 example is *not* an AND gate.
